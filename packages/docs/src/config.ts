 * origin here rather than from the token response the way the doc editor does via
 * resolveCollabWsUrl above. Both target the SAME backend WS router — the unified router resolves
 * doc names and 5-segment `:wb:` board names on one server (see the token contract note in
 * `useWhiteboardSession.ts`). There is no separate "board collab" service.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *  1. `VITE_COLLAB_WS_ENDPOINT` (build-arg) — explicit per-environment override, used verbatim.
 *  2. Runtime origin-derived default — when the build-arg is not injected, derive the endpoint
 *     from the page's own host so the deployed bundle reaches the collab server co-located with
 *     it (`ws(s)://<page-host>:<port>`) instead of an unreachable placeholder. The collab port
 *     defaults to the Hocuspocus default 1234 and can be overridden with `VITE_COLLAB_WS_PORT`.
 *     This mirrors the same-origin asset-host trust below and the `window.location.origin`
 *     invite-link derivation — preferring a runtime-derived host over a hardcoded IP keeps the
 *     bundle multi-environment without a rebuild.
 *  3. SSR / unit-test fallback (no `window`) — localhost, never a public placeholder host.
 *
 * The previous default `wss://collab.octo.example.com` was an unreachable placeholder: any
 * deployment built without `VITE_COLLAB_WS_ENDPOINT` silently fell back to it, so every collab
 * socket failed with `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` and real-time sync (doc + board) never worked.
